        <h1>About Neverland Arts & Entertainment</h1>
        <p>Neverland Arts & Entertainments Inc. was registered as a Corporation in February 2015. We are scheduled to open for full operation in 2016 as a multi complex sports/arts facility. Neverland is designed to cater to a clientele of all ages.</p>
        <p>Our Mission: Helping people in the Peel Region reach their highest athletic and performance goals in their respective disciplines as an athlete or performer with the highest quality in coaching, training, and management methods.</p>
        <p>Neverland will be a one of a kind “one stop shop” facility with an athletic and production component to our business structure. We will focus on the athletic side of the business by helping clients/members from toddler to adult realize their athletic potential in a fun, safe, hardworking environment.</p>
        <p>From the production side of the business, athletes have the opportunity to graduate from a competitive career into a performance career or a behind the scenes position as part of the creative team or technical team, for future shows employed by Neverland Productions. Not many, if any sporting facilities can claim that they offer such growth potential to its clientele.</p>
        <p>At Neverland we offer a plethora of activities and classes for kids and adults, including Gymnastics, Power Tumbling, Cheerleading, Circus Arts, Skateboarding, Trampoline, Rock Climbing(coming soon), Dance (coming soon) since they complement each other. At Neverland we believe that if you can dream it, it can be reality! So our goal at Neverland is to blur the line between dreams and reality. We like to call it Dreamality! At Neverland we’re always open to new ideas and strongly encourage collaboration, it takes a village, to do stuff, or something like that (lol). Let us help each other turn our dreams into reality.</p>
