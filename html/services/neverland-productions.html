            <h3>Chinese Pole</h3>
            <h6></h6>
            <p>Chinese Pole takes ground acrobatic skills to new heights! Whether holding difficult static positions or kicking off the pole to perform somersaults, heart skipping drops or slides, the Chinese Pole will keep the audience at the edge of their seats. As an aerial discipline, it's interesting. Different to Corde Lisse or silks or trapeze because the terrain of the equipment is always unyielding. The pole is rigid, and there's no way to wrap-in or to truly rest; it's simultaneously easier to climb and harder to be on, requiring precise skill and accuracy.</p>
